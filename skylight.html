                    <h3 class="name">Fixed Deposits</h3>
                    <p class="text">This plan is similar to the daily thrift savings plan but differs in duration and pattern. The plan encourages members to save for longer periods (usually one year). It is patterned in such a way that withdrawal is discouraged until the duration completes. The plan also rewards members who diligently complete it with a 5% interest on the amount saved, paid at the end of the savings cycle. The amount saved in this plan is predefined by Skylight Cooperative.
                         The offers currently available in this plan are shown in Appendix</p>

                    <h3 class="name">flexible Deposits (Akawo)</h3>
                    <p class="text">This plan avails users the opportunity to set aside a stipulated amount daily over some time, accrued monthly. The plan primarily rewards its participants with developing the discipline of daily savings and the realisation of how funds can be saved over time by setting a little aside consistently and on daily basis.
                    The plan is designed such that each member decides how much to set aside daily. Skylight Cooperative provides an easy and innovative way of collecting and storing up the funds for the members over a 31-day period. 
                    The funds saved are available to the respective members at any time upon notice of withdrawal.</p>

                    <p class="text">This plan is designed to help members stock up their food reserves by deploying a gradual installment system. The plan encourages daily or weekly contributions geared towards the acquisition of foodstuff. When the plan is completed, the member receives the food items listed in the respective plans. 
                        The amount saved in this plan and the duration of the plan depends on the quantity of foodstuff listed.</p>

                    <h3 class="name">products/appliances savings</h3>
                    <p class="text">This plan is similar to the Food item contribution plan. The plans defer, however, in the sense that rather than saving for food items, members save for household appliances or other products that they desire to own. These appliances and products may be cumbersome to buy for many families. 
                        This plan, therefore, enables the acquisition of desired appliances through the discipline and flexibility of daily savings. The products and appliances vary in size, cost and type, thus the daily amount and duration required to acquire them also varies.</p>
